# Universal Function Approximation Through Over-the-air Computing: A Deep Learning Approach
TensorFlow implementation of the paper: [Universal Function Approximation Through Over-the-air Computing: A Deep Learning Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506799)
## Description
The scripts `MSE_vs_SNR_flat_fading.py` and `MSE_vs_users_flat_fading.py` can be used to reproduce the results of the paper. Some straightforward modifications of the scripts may be needed to generate all figures. Additionally, while the script `MSE_vs_SNR_selective_fading.py` was not utilized in the paper, it is functional and can be employed for the case of selective frequency fading channels. Finally, note that the device's transmit power has been set equal to 1W in the simulation settings of the paper, and thus, does not explicitly appears in the scripts.
